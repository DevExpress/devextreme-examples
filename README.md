# DevExtreme Examples

A set of sample applications that will help you get started with DevExtreme.

## DevExtreme Modules

Each example in this section holds a simple application containing a dxButton widget with an alert dialog. It is enough to demonstrate how to link the required DevExtreme modules to the application using [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/), [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/) or [jspm](http://jspm.io/) with [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/) or [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) approach. All examples require Node.js and npm to install [DevExtreme](http://js.devexpress.com/) package and its dependencies. Basic principles of working with these tools would be also helpful.
